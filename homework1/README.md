A quaternion is a mathematical concept that extends the idea of complex numbers to four dimensions. This code defines a Quaternion class that represents quaternions and provides methods for common operations on quaternions.

## Methods

The Quaternion class provides the following methods:

**plus:** Returns the sum of two quaternions. <br>
**minus:** Returns the difference of two quaternions. <br>
**times:** Returns the product of two quaternions. <br>
**norm:** Returns the norm of a quaternion. <br>
**normalized:** Returns the normalization of a quaternion. <br>
**conjugate:** Returns the conjugate of a quaternion. <br>
**inverse:** Returns the inverse of a quaternion. <br>
**coefficients:** Returns an immutable list of the four coefficients of a quaternion, in order. <br>
The Quaternion class also provides the following constants:

**ZERO:** The quaternion with all coefficients equal to 0. <br>
**I:** The quaternion with coefficients (1, 0, 0, 0). <br>
**J:** The quaternion with coefficients (0, 1, 0, 0). <br>
**K:** The quaternion with coefficients (0, 0, 0, 1)
