A quaternion is a mathematical concept that extends the idea of complex numbers to four dimensions. This code defines a Quaternion class that represents quaternions and provides methods for common operations on quaternions.

Methods

The Quaternion class provides the following methods:

plus: Returns the sum of two quaternions.
minus: Returns the difference of two quaternions.
times: Returns the product of two quaternions.
norm: Returns the norm of a quaternion.
normalized: Returns the normalization of a quaternion.
conjugate: Returns the conjugate of a quaternion.
inverse: Returns the inverse of a quaternion.
coefficients: Returns an immutable list of the four coefficients of a quaternion, in order.
The Quaternion class also provides the following constants:

ZERO: The quaternion with all coefficients equal to 0.
I: The quaternion with coefficients (1, 0, 0, 0).
J: The quaternion with coefficients (0, 1, 0, 0).
K: The quaternion with coefficients (0,
